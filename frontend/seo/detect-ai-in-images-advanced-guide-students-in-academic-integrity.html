  <h2>Key signals</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-signal fusion: combine model outputs with heuristic and EXIF/provenance checks.</li>
      <li>Thresholds and ROC-aware decisions that reflect your false positive budget.</li>
      <li>Context-aware policies that differ for academic integrity vs public UGC.</li>
      <li>Human-in-the-loop review paths and audit trails for escalations.</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring for drift, adversarial inputs, and data shift.</li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Workflow</h2>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Ingest assets and normalize formats and color profiles.</li>
      <li>Extract metadata and text; compute primary detection signals.</li>
      <li>Apply business rules and provenance/watermark checks.</li>
      <li>Score, threshold, and route to auto-approve or review queue.</li>
      <li>Log decisions and ground truth for retraining and audits.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Deep dive</h2>
  
    <p>In practice, AI image detection in production raises considerations around evaluation metrics, data quality, and operational guardrails. Practitioners balance recall vs. precision, mitigate bias and drift, and implement layered controls that combine model signals, heuristics, and provenance checks. Teams should agree on escalation thresholds, human-in-the-loop reviews, and audit logging to ensure traceability. When deploying at scale, focus on maintainability, monitoring, and incident response—these matter as much as raw model quality.

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  
    <h3>Common failure modes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Overfitting to a narrow dataset; expand coverage and hard negatives.</li>
      <li>Thresholds copied across contexts; recalibrate for each surface.</li>
      <li>Ignoring user feedback; bake in loop to learn from corrections.</li>
      <li>Unobserved drift; add dashboards and alerting on input/output stats.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
    
<pre><code>def eval_threshold(y_true, y_score, cost_fp=5, cost_fn=1):
    # find T minimizing expected cost
    ...
    return T_best</code></pre>

</section>


<section>
  <h2>Playbook</h2>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Define the unacceptable outcomes and your cost model.</li>
      <li>Choose metrics (AUPRC, FPR@TPR) and evaluation protocol.</li>
      <li>Ship a baseline with simple guardrails and great observability.</li>
      <li>Iterate via error analysis; add features and hard negatives.</li>
      <li>Institutionalize postmortems and RCA for misses.</li>
    </ol>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Evaluation metrics</h2>
  
    <p>Optimize toward business costs. For imbalanced data, prefer PR curves and report calibrated operating points. Provide uncertainty bands and consider stratified performance across key cohorts.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Dataset & bias</h2>
  
    <p>Curate diverse datasets, document sources, and perform fairness checks. Track data lineage and permissions. Use model cards and data sheets to share limits transparently.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Risk & governance</h2>
  
    <p>Build controls aligned to academic integrity requirements. Include approvals, audit logging, and clear ownership. Integrate with incident response and legal escalation paths.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Publisher intake flow: auto-approve low-risk, escalate edge cases.</li>
      <li>Academic submission checker: highlight risky spans, require citations.</li>
      <li>Enterprise asset review: integrate with DLP and recordkeeping.</li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  
    <h3>Is 100% accuracy possible?</h3>
    <p>No—focus on acceptable risk at the right thresholds with human review.</p>
    <h3>How do we reduce false positives?</h3>
    <p>Use multiple independent signals and calibrate per-context thresholds; tune to business cost.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Checklist</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Define costs and metrics</li>
      <li>Instrument logging and dashboards</li>
      <li>Establish review routes</li>
      <li>Ship baseline, iterate via error analysis</li>
      <li>Document limits and governance</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Great detection systems are engineered experiences: layered, explainable, and continuously improved. Treat them as products, not one-off models.</p>
