<section>
  <h2>Key signals</h2>
  
    <p>Start with multi-signal fusion that blends model outputs with provenance and metadata analysis. Calibrate thresholds with ROC-aware thinking to reflect your false positive budget. Policies should be context-aware—what works for enterprise governance rarely maps one-to-one to public UGC. Preserve human-in-the-loop review with audit trails for escalations, and invest early in monitoring for drift, adversarial inputs, and data shifts.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Workflow</h2>
  
    <p>The practical workflow begins with ingestion and normalization (formats, color profiles), followed by metadata extraction and signal computation. Layer business rules, provenance, and watermark checks before scoring and routing. Use thresholds to auto-approve low-risk items and queue edge cases for review. Close the loop by logging decisions with ground truth to power retraining and audits.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Deep dive</h2>
  
    <p>In practice, AI image detection in production raises considerations around evaluation metrics, data quality, and operational guardrails. Practitioners balance recall vs. precision, mitigate bias and drift, and implement layered controls that combine model signals, heuristics, and provenance checks. Teams should agree on escalation thresholds, human-in-the-loop reviews, and audit logging to ensure traceability. When deploying at scale, focus on maintainability, monitoring, and incident response—these matter as much as raw model quality.

<section>
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  
    <h3>Common failure modes</h3>
    <p>Most issues trace back to overfitting or miscalibration. Expand coverage with hard negatives, recalibrate thresholds for each surface instead of copy-pasting, and treat user feedback as training data. If drift goes unobserved, your dashboards and alerting on input/output distributions need an upgrade.</p>
    <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
    
<pre><code>def eval_threshold(y_true, y_score, cost_fp=5, cost_fn=1):
    # find T minimizing expected cost
    ...
    return T_best</code></pre>

</section>


<section>
  <h2>Playbook</h2>
  
    <p>Define unacceptable outcomes and the cost model up front. Favor metrics like AUPRC and calibrated operating points over one-size-fits-all accuracy. Ship a baseline with strong guardrails and observability, then iterate via error analysis—adding features and hard negatives. Institutionalize postmortems and root-cause analysis so improvements compound.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Evaluation metrics</h2>
  
    <p>Optimize toward business costs. With imbalanced data, PR curves and calibrated thresholds are more informative than raw accuracy. Provide uncertainty bands and stratify performance across key cohorts to catch inequities early.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Dataset & bias</h2>
  
    <p>Curate diverse datasets with documented sources, permissions, and lineage. Bake in fairness checks from day one. Publish model cards and data sheets so consumers understand capabilities and limits—transparency reduces misuse and surprise.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Risk & governance</h2>
  
    <p>Build controls aligned to enterprise governance requirements. Include approvals, audit logging, and clear ownership boundaries. Integrate with incident response and legal escalation paths before an incident forces you to.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  
    <p>In a publisher intake flow, low-risk items are auto-approved while edge cases escalate to reviewers. In academic submissions, the system highlights risky spans and asks for citations. For enterprise asset review, detections integrate with DLP and recordkeeping to maintain compliance without grinding workflows to a halt.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  
    <h3>Is 100% accuracy possible?</h3>
    <p>No. Mature systems target acceptable risk at the right thresholds with clear paths to human review.</p>
    <h3>How do we reduce false positives?</h3>
    <p>Use independent signals, tune per-context thresholds, and align the objective to business cost—what you measure is what you improve.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Checklist</h2>
  
    <p>Before launch, document costs and metrics, instrument logging and dashboards, and establish review routes. Ship a baseline and tighten it via error analysis. Keep documentation and governance current—today’s assumptions age fast.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Great detection systems are engineered experiences: layered, explainable, and continuously improved. Treat them as products, not one-off models.</p>
